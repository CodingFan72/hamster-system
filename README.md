Folder-System
=============
**# bundle @ project . subproject - folder**

Organize your documents. Simple folder system inspired in [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done), [Secret Weapon](http://www.thesecretweapon.org/media/Manifesto/The-Secret-Weapon-Manifesto.pdf) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)'s concept of *#* and *@*. 

*Notes:*

*This system was tested in a personal computer (only one user) using Windows and Evernote.*

*If you don't know GTD and Secret Weapon you must read about it first or this folder system will not make much sense.*

###So how to organize your documents?

---
**Main folders:**

- your main folder: **ALL CAPS**

        Your documents folder will be named with your name or/and surname in ALL CAPS.
        Example: JOHN

- action time: **{ }**
    
        Inside your main folder there are 3 folders:
        {inbox}, {next actions} and {archive}
    
- action area: **[ ]** 
    
        Inside folder {next actions} there are 3 folders with action areas:
        [personal], [work], [family]
    
        Inside folder {archive} there are 3 folders with action areas and archive symbol: 
        +[personal], +[work], +[family]

        Inside folder {inbox} there are no folders. {inbox} is a folder for temporarary stuff.

**Folders:**

- bundle of projects (inspired in twitter hashtag): **#**
    
        Inside folders [personal], [work] and [family] you can have bundles of projects. 
        Example: #large investor (bundle with all projects of a client) 

- project (inspired in twitter mention): **@**
    
        Example: @house in lisbon

- sub project: **.**
    
        Example: .building permit

- folder (inside a sub project): **-**
    
        Example: -sections

You can combine this notation:

        Example: #large investor@house in lisbon
        Example: @house in lisbon.building permit
        Example: .building permit-sections

---
**Files:**

- standard file: **$**
    
        Example: $curriculum
    
---
**Archive:**

- archived folder: **+**
    
        Example: +[family]

- archived file (version): **+**
    
        Example: plan+5.12

---    
**Others:** *(Use it mostly to detail GTD actions in evernote)*

- insert a comment: **(comment)**
    
        Example: Write a mail to Susy (your comment here)

- insert a date: **(year-month-day=hour)**
    
        Use it in the beggining of the line to simplify search.
        Example: (2012-11-29=9h) Doctor appointment
        
- you can use UpperCamelCase, lowerCamelCase or snake_case: 
    
        Example using lowerCamelCase: #largeInvestor@houseInLisbon.buildingPermit
        Example using UpperCamelCase: #LargeInvestor@HouseInLisbon.BuildingPermit
        Example using snake_case: #large_investor@house_in_lisbon.building_permit

- Or just use spaces, not everybody is a geek:

        Example using spaces: #large investor@house in lisbon.building permit

- Great free tool for [batch renaming](http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Screenshots.php).

**How to navigate through your files:**

In desktop you only need 2-3 permanent (and some temporary) *shortcuts* that allow to navigate your files: 
		
- shortcut to *{inbox}*

		The folder to put new files until you decide what to do with them.
		
- shortcut to *{next actions}*

		The folder where you store your current projects

- if you use it often, a shortcut to *{archive}*

		The folder where you store your archived projects

- *temporary* shortcuts to specific folders
