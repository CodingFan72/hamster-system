Folder-System
=============
**#bundle_project.subproject-folder**

Organize your documents. System based in *actions* inspired in [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) and [Secret Weapon](http://www.thesecretweapon.org/media/Manifesto/The-Secret-Weapon-Manifesto.pdf). 

*Notes:*

*If you don't know GTD and Secret Weapon you should read about it first or this folder system organization will not make much sense.*

*This system was tested in a personal computer (only one user) using Windows and Evernote.*

###So how can you organize your documents?

---
**Main folders**

- your main folder: **Uppercase**

        Your documents folder will be named with your name or/and surname in uppercase.
        Example: JOHN

- action time: **{ }**
    
        Inside your main folder there are 3 folders:
        {inbox}, {next actions} and {archive}
    
- action area: **[ ]** 
    
        Inside folder {next actions} there are 3 folders with action areas:
        [personal], [work], [family]
    
        Inside folder {archive} there are 3 folders with action areas and archive symbol: 
        %[personal], %[work], %[family]

        Inside folder {inbox} there are no folders. {inbox} is a folder for temporarary stuff.

**Folders**

- bundle of projects: **#** or **+**
    
        Inside folders [personal], [work] and [family] you can have bundles of projects. 
        Example: #large investor (bundle with all projects of a client) 

- project: **_**
    
        Example: _house in lisbon

- sub project: **.**
    
        Example: .building permit

- folder (inside a sub project): **-**
    
        Example: -sections

You can combine this notation:

        Example: #large investor_house in lisbon
        Example: _house in lisbon.building permit
        Example: .building permit-sections

---
**Files:**

- standard file: **$**
    
        Example: $curriculum
    
---
**Archive:**

- archive folder: **%**
    
        Example: %[family]

- archive file (version): **@**
    
        Example: plan@5.12

---    
**Others** *(Use it mostly to detail GTD actions in evernote)*

- insert a comment: **(comment)**
    
        Example: Write a mail to Susy (your comment here)

- insert a comment with a date: **(year-month-day=hour)**
    
        Example: Doctor appointment (2012-11-29=9h)

- spaces or camelCAse as you wish. Not everybody is a geek..
    
        Example: #large investor_house in lisbon.building permit
        Example: #largeInvestor_houseInLisbon.buildingPermit
