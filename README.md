Folder-System
=============

Organize your files and folders. Inspired in [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) and [Secret Weapon](http://www.thesecretweapon.org/media/Manifesto/The-Secret-Weapon-Manifesto.pdf).

If you don't know what GTD and Secret Weapon you should read about it first or this will not make much sense to you.

###So how do I organize folder system?

---
**Main folders**

- main folder: **Uppercase**

        Your folder should be your name or/and surname in uppercase.
        Example: JOHN

- action time: **{ }**
    
        Inside the main folder with your name you have 3 folders.
        Example: {inbox}, {next actions} and {archive}
    
- action area: **[ ]** 
    
        Inside folder {next actions} you have 3 folders with action areas.
        Examples: [personal], [work], [family]
    
        Inside folder {archive} you have 3 folders with action areas combined with archive symbol. 
        Examples: %[personal], %[work], %[family]

**Folders**

- bundle of projects: **#** or **+**
    
        Inside folders [personal], [work] and [family] you can have bundles of projects. 
        Example: You have several projects for a client. You can make a bundle #mediaInvestor

- project: **_**
    
        Example: _house in lisbon, or if you want a referenced folder #media investor_house in lisbon

- sub project: **.**
    
        Example: _house in lisbon.building permit

- folder (inside a sub project): **-**
    
        Example: .building permit-sections

---
**Files:**

- standard file: **$**
    
        Example: $curriculum or $curriculum@1.14
    
---
**Archive:**

- archive folder: **%**
    
        Example: %[family]

- archive file (version): **@**
    
        Example: plan@5.12

---    
**Others** *(I use it to detail actions in evernote)*

- to insert a comment: **(comment)**
    
        Example: Write a mail to Susy (your comment here)

- to insert a date: **(2012-10-14=9h)**
    
        Example: Doctor appointment (2012-10-14=9h)
