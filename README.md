Folder-System
=============
**# bundle @ project . subproject - folder**

Organize your documents. Simple folder system inspired in [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)<sup>2</sup>, [Secret Weapon](http://www.thesecretweapon.org/media/Manifesto/The-Secret-Weapon-Manifesto.pdf)<sup>2</sup> and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)'s concept of *#* and *@*. 

<sup>1 -This system was tested in a personal computer (only one user) using Windows and Evernote.</sup>
<sup>2 -If you don't know GTD and Secret Weapon you must read about it first or this folder system will not make much sense.</sup>

####Main Folders:

- your main folder: **ALL CAPS**

        First of all you create a folder in a safe place of your disk.
        ALL your stuff will be stored inside this folder named with your name 
        or/and surname using ALL CAPS.
        Example: JOHN

- action time: **{ }**
    
        Inside your main folder there are 3 folders:
        {inbox}, {next actions} and {archive}
    
- action scope: **[ ]** 

        Inside folder {inbox} there are no permanent folders, just temporary stuff.

        Inside folder {next actions} there are 2 folders with action scopes:
        [personal], [work]
    
        Inside folder {archive} there are 2 folders with action scopes and archive symbol: 
        +[personal], +[work]

---
####Folders:

- bundle of projects (inspired in twitter hashtag): **#**
    
        Inside folders [personal], [work] you can have bundles of projects. 
        Example: #large investor (bundle with all projects of a client)
        Example: #family (bundle with all your family related projects)

- project (inspired in twitter mention): **@**
    	
    	Inside folders [personal], [work] or bundles you have projects. 
        Example: @house in lisbon

- subproject: **.**
    	
    	Inside projects you can have subprojects.
        Example: .building permit

- folder: **-**
    	
    	Inside subprojects you can have folders.
        Example: -sections

When naming folders you can combine this notation (adding the previous naming level) 
to reduce the need of memorization while navigating:

        Example: #large investor@house in lisbon
        Example: @house in lisbon.building permit
        Example: .building permit-sections

---
####Files:

- standard file: **$**
    
        Example: $curriculum
    
---
####Archive:

- archived folder: **+**
    
        Example: +[work]

- archived file (version): **+**
    
        Example: plan+v012

---
####How to navigate through your documents:

You only need 2 permanent (and some temporary) *desktop shortcuts* to navigate your files: 
		
- shortcut to *{inbox}*

		{inbox} is the folder where you put new files until deciding what to do with them.
		
- shortcut to *{next actions}*

		{next actions} is the folder where you store your current projects.

- if you use it often (in theory you don't - they are archived projects), a shortcut to *{archive}*

		{archive} is the folder where you store your archived projects.

- *temporary* shortcuts to specific folders that you use a lot.

		Example: #large investor@house in lisbon
		Example: [work] #large investor
		Example: [personal] #friends

####Others: 

- insert a comment (to detail GTD actions in evernote): **(comment)**

        Example: Write a mail to Susy (your comment here)

- insert a date (to detail GTD actions in evernote): **(year-month-day=hour)**

        Use it in the beggining of the line to allow chronological sorting.
        Example: (2012-11-29=9h) Doctor appointment
        
- name your folders using UpperCamelCase, lowerCamelCase or snake_case: 

        Example using lowerCamelCase: #largeInvestor@houseInLisbon.buildingPermit
        Example using UpperCamelCase: #LargeInvestor@HouseInLisbon.BuildingPermit
        Example using snake_case: #large_investor@house_in_lisbon.building_permit

- or just use spaces, not everybody is a geek:

        Example using spaces: #large investor@house in lisbon.building permit
