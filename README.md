If you don't know what GTD and Secret Weapon you should read about it first or this will not make much sense to you.

###So how do I organize folders in my computer (folder system and evernote)?
---
**Main folders**

your folder: **Uppercase**

    Your folder should be your name or/and surname in uppercase. Example: JOHN

action times: **{ }**
    
    Inside the main folder with your name you have 3 folders. Example: {inbox}, {next actions} and {archive}
    
action areas: **[ ]** 
    
    Inside folder {next actions} you have 3 folders with action areas. Examples: [personal], [work], [family]
    
    Inside folder {archive} you have 3 folders with action areas combined with archive symbol. Examples: %[personal], %[work], %[family]

**Folders**

bundle of projects: **#** or **+**
    
    Inside folders [personal], [work] and [family] you can have bundles of projects. Example: You have several projects for a client. You can make a bundle #mediaInvestor

project: **_**
    
    Each project you have. Example: _house in lisbon, or if you want a referenced folder #media investor_house in lisbon

sub project: **.**
    
    example: _house in lisbon.building permit

folder (inside a sub project): **-**
    
    example: .building permit-sections

---
**Files:**

standard file: **$**
    
    example: $curriculum or $curriculum@1.14
    
---
**Archive:**

archive folder: **%**
    
    example: %[family]

archive file (version) **@3.2**
    
    example: plan@5.12

---    
**Others** *(I use it to detail actions in evernote)*

to insert a comment: **(comment)**
    
    example: Write a mail to Susy (your comment here)

to insert a date: **(2012-10-14=9h)**
    
    example: Doctor appointment (2012-10-14=9h)
