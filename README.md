###So, how can you start?

**Organize your documents:**

- [Others](#others)

**Organize your workflow:**

###// Organize your documents

===
####Main folder:

First of all create a folder in a safe place of your disk.
ALL your stuff will be stored here<sup> 2</sup>. 

- main folder: **YOUR NAME**

		Rename this folder with your name or/and surname using ALL CAPS.
        Example: JOHN

- project status: **{ }**

        Inside your main folder there are 3 folders:

        {inbox} folder where you put new documents until deciding what to do with them.
        {current} folder where you store your current projects.
        {archive} folder where you store your archived projects.
    
- project scope: **[ ]** 

        Inside:

        {inbox} there aren't permanent folders, just temporary stuff.
        {current} there are 2 folders: [personal], [work]
        {archive} there are 2 folders with archive symbol: +[personal], +[work]

        Inside these folders with project scopes you will store your projects.

===
####Project folders:

*# bundle @ project . subproject - folder - nested folder*

- bundle of projects (inspired in twitter hashtag): **#**

        Inside folders [personal], [work] you can have bundles of projects:
        Example: #large investor (bundle with all projects of a client)
        Example: #family (bundle with all your family related projects)

- project<sup> 3</sup> (inspired in twitter mention): **@**

    	Inside folders [personal], [work] or bundles you have projects:
        Example: @house in lisbon

        To reduce the need of memorization, when naming the project folder
        you can also add the bundle name (if existent):
        Example: #large investor@house in lisbon

- subproject (inspired in object oriented programming): **.**

    	Inside projects you can have subprojects:
        Example: .building permit

        To reduce the need of memorization, when naming the subproject folder
        you can also add the project name:
        Example: @house in lisbon.building permit

- folder (each nesting level): **-**

    	Inside subprojects you can have folders:
        Example: -plans

        On nested folders you can add previous folder(s) name to reduce the need of memorization:
        Example: -drawings-sections
        Example: -drawings-details-wall

===
####Files:

- files named using folders logic or other naming system relevant to your job.

        Example using folder's naming logic: plan+0.1.2
        Example using other naming system: @ARC.EXE-plan+0.1.2

- archived file using [SemVer](http://www.semver.org/) (each version *adds* a change on data): **+ major . minor . patch** 
        
        Example: plan+0.1.2

- prefix for standard / boilerplate files: **$**

        Example: $curriculum+1.1.2  

===
####How to navigate through your documents:

- you only need 2 *permanent desktop shortcuts* to navigate your documents: 

        Shortcut to {inbox}
        Shortcut to {current}

        If you use it often (in theory you don't, they are archived projects):
        Shortcut to {archive}

- and some *temporary desktop shortcuts* to specific folders that you use a lot.

===
####Others:

- use camelCase, PascalCase or spaces<sup> 4</sup>:

        Example using camelCase: #largeInvestor@houseInLisbon
        Example using PascalCase: #LargeInvestor@HouseInLisbon
        Example using spaces: #large investor@house in lisbon  

- but avoid these symbols for regular naming: **# @ . - + $ % { } [ ]**

- great free tool for [batch renaming](http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Screenshots.php).

###// Organize your workflow

===
####Introduction:

- resuming, in Hamster-GTD workflow:
  - undivisible tasks are called *actions*.
  - a list of actions is called *briefing*.
  - non-actionable items are called *notes* or *references*.

- for workflow management, Hamster-GTD uses a simplified version of [Secret Weapon](http://www.thesecretweapon.org/media/Manifesto/The-Secret-Weapon-Manifesto.pdf)<sup> 1</sup>.<br>
Main differences (you may also check [how does it look](#how-does-it-look)):

  - different notebook structure:

           1.Inbox (temporary storage before deciding what to do with an item)
           2.Actions (to store all actions)
           3.Briefings (to store all briefings)
           4.Cabinet (to store all notes/project references)
  
  - simplified *.When* tags for *actions*:

           1-Next (next actions to be done)
           2-Soon (actions in the queue to be done)
           3-Someday & maybe (actions to be done later/someday & maybe)
           4-Waiting (actions with a starting date to be done/get feedback)
           5-Calendar (actions with a precise/deadline date to be done)

####Actions:

- undivisible tasks are called *actions*. Actions are managed in one Evernote<sup> 5</sup> notebook.

- if you need to detail an action: **( )**

        Insert a comment: (comment)
        Example: Write a mail to Susy (your comment here)

        Insert a strict date: (year-month-day=hour)
        Insert dates in the beggining of the line to allow chronological sorting:
        Example: (2012-11-29=9h) Doctor appointment

        Insert a starting date: (date >>)
        Example: (2013-03-10 >>) Waiting for client feedback after this date

        Insert a deadline date: (date <<)
        Example: (2014-10-22 <<) Pay electricity bill before this date

####Briefings:

- a list of actions is called *briefing*. Briefings are managed in one Evernote<sup> 5</sup> notebook.

####Cabinet:

- to simplify and optimize your workflow, items for reference that arenâ€™t actionable (project references and notes) are always stored here (not inside project folders) and managed in one Evernote<sup> 6</sup> major notebook (and several nested notebooks).

- name your notes using project folders notation:

        Note with all references regarding a particular subproject:
        Example: @house in lisbon.building permit

- suggestion: use notes to keep your bookmark collections. It will allow easy access and share:

		Example: @resources.frontend-bootstrap

<sup>Notes:</sup><br>
<sup>1 - Without understanding it, this system will not make much sense.</sup><br>
<sup>2 - The hamster cheeks :)</sup><br>
<sup>3 - In GTD any document belongs to a project.</sup><br>
<sup>4 - snake_case is not recommended due to search difficulties in Evernote.</sup><br>
<sup>5 - Other note taking apps might work also.</sup>
