Folder-System
=============
**#bundle_project.subproject-folder**

Organize your files and folders. System inspired in [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) and [Secret Weapon](http://www.thesecretweapon.org/media/Manifesto/The-Secret-Weapon-Manifesto.pdf).

If you don't know GTD and Secret Weapon you should read about it first or this will not make much sense to you.

###So how do I organize the folder system?

---
**Main folders**

- main folder: **Uppercase**

        Your folder should be your name or/and surname in uppercase.
        Example: JOHN

- action time: **{ }**
    
        Inside your main folder there are 3 folders.
        Example: {inbox}, {next actions} and {archive}
    
- action area: **[ ]** 
    
        Inside folder {next actions} there are 3 folders with action areas.
        Example: [personal], [work], [family]
    
        Inside folder {archive} there are 3 folders with action areas and archive symbol. 
        Example: %[personal], %[work], %[family]

**Folders**

- bundle of projects: **#** or **+**
    
        Inside folders [personal], [work] and [family] you can have bundles of projects. 
        Example: #media investor (bundle with all projects of a client) 

- project: **_**
    
        Example: _house in lisbon

- sub project: **.**
    
        Example: .building permit

- folder (inside a sub project): **-**
    
        Example: -sections

You can combine this notation:

        Example: #media investor_house in lisbon
        Example: _house in lisbon.building permit
        Example: .building permit-sections

---
**Files:**

- standard file: **$**
    
        Example: $curriculum
    
---
**Archive:**

- archive folder: **%**
    
        Example: %[family]

- archive file (version): **@**
    
        Example: plan@5.12

---    
**Others** *(Use it mostly to detail GTD actions in evernote)*

- to insert a comment: **(comment)**
    
        Example: Write a mail to Susy (your comment here)

- to insert a date: **(2012-10-14=9h)**
    
        Example: Doctor appointment (2012-10-14=9h)
